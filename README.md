> [!NOTE]
> This is my first Lua script, so here I am, offering you this little bundle! It’s not perfect, there are still some inconsistencies ... but the main goal is to have fun. I’ll be updating the script regularly to improve it, setting myself a small challenge and immersing myself in the world of Lua development!
